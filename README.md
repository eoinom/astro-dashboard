This project is an example of creating a multi-framework web application using Astro and is based on the following [blog article](https://blog.logrocket.com/building-multi-framework-dashboard-with-astro/). The application is a sample e-commerce dashboard and incorporates components from three of the most popular frontend frameworks: React, Svelte, and Vue.js.
